## Ranking Documents for Information Retrieval with Priority Queues

In this project, I used binomial heaps to implement a priority queue for the task of ranking documents. In other words, rank documents according to given keyword with binomial heaps.
In the folder of files, there are 42 documents.

The following steps have been followed in this project

1. Open the folder and read the files.
2. Ask the user for the keyword and pass it to your program as the keyword
parameter
3. Decide your heap structure whether you choose max-heap or min-heap.
4. Build a priority queue with the keyword.
5. By using your priority queue data structures in (4), extract the relevant 5
documents with the keyword.
6. Discuss your results in (5) and advantages using priority queue for such a
problem.
